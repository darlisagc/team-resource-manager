# Executive Summary

**Galactic Resource Command** (Team Resource Manager) is a comprehensive team resource management platform designed to help engineering teams track OKRs (Objectives and Key Results), manage capacity, and monitor team health through weekly check-ins.

The platform features a unique Star Wars-inspired theme, providing an engaging user experience while delivering powerful resource management capabilities.

**Key Value Propositions:**
- Unified OKR tracking and resource planning
- Real-time team capacity visibility
- Weekly check-in system with mood tracking (Force Index)
- Automated status transitions and progress tracking
- Flexible export capabilities for PMO reporting

# Business Perspective

## Problem Statement

Engineering teams face several challenges in resource management:

1. **Visibility Gap**: Managers lack real-time visibility into team capacity and workload distribution
2. **OKR Tracking Friction**: Tracking progress on objectives requires manual updates across multiple systems
3. **Capacity Planning**: Estimating resource needs for upcoming quarters is time-consuming and error-prone
4. **Team Health Monitoring**: No systematic way to track team morale and identify blockers early
5. **Reporting Overhead**: Generating PMO reports requires manual data aggregation

## Solution Overview

### Core Capabilities

| Capability | Business Value |
|------------|----------------|
| **OKR Management** | Hierarchical goal tracking (Goals → Key Results → Initiatives) with automatic progress rollup |
| **Capacity Planning** | FTE-based estimation with per-member allocation visibility |
| **Weekly Check-ins** | Structured time tracking with mood monitoring (Force Index) |
| **Dashboard Analytics** | Real-time utilization charts with multicolor visualization |
| **Automated Workflows** | Status auto-transitions, progress calculations, and alerts |
| **Export & Reporting** | CSV/JSON exports for PMO integration |

### Business Metrics Tracked

- **Team Utilization Rate**: Percentage of available capacity being used
- **Goal Progress**: Completion percentage across all OKRs
- **Force Index**: Team morale indicator (GRANDMASTER → PADAWAN scale)
- **Capacity Allocation**: Distribution across Time Off, Events, and Work

### ROI Benefits

1. **Time Savings**: Automated status updates and progress calculations reduce manual tracking by ~60%
2. **Improved Visibility**: Real-time dashboards eliminate weekly status meeting overhead
3. **Better Planning**: Historical data enables more accurate capacity forecasting
4. **Early Warning**: Force Index trends identify team health issues before they escalate

## Target Users

| Role | Primary Use Cases |
|------|-------------------|
| **Engineering Manager** | Dashboard monitoring, capacity planning, team health tracking |
| **Team Lead** | Goal updates, initiative management, weekly reviews |
| **Individual Contributor** | Weekly check-ins, time allocation reporting |
| **PMO/Leadership** | Export reports, cross-team visibility |

   - 🌑 **PADAWAN** - Blocked, needs help
5. Click **Submit**

### Updating OKRs

## Key Features Explained

### Dashboard - Crew Utilization Chart

The stacked bar chart shows each team member's workload breakdown:

| Color | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| 🔴 Red (#FF6B6B) | Time Off (PTO, holidays, sick leave) |
| 🟣 Purple (#A855F7) | Events (meetings, training, conferences) |
| 🔵 Cyan (#4BD5EE) | Work Allocation (actual project work) |

**User names are displayed in orange (#FF6B35)** for visibility.

### Force Index

The Force Index measures team morale based on weekly check-in mood submissions:

| Level | Score | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| ⚔️ GRANDMASTER | 3.5-4.0 | Team is thriving |
| 🗡️ JEDI MASTER | 2.5-3.4 | Team is healthy |
| ✨ JEDI KNIGHT | 1.5-2.4 | Some challenges |
| 🌑 PADAWAN | 1.0-1.4 | Team needs support |

When no check-ins exist, the display shows: *"The Force is silent..."*

### Auto-Status Transitions

The system automatically updates statuses based on actions:

| Trigger | Status Change |
|---------|---------------|
| Hours logged via check-in | Active → **In Progress** |
| Progress reaches 100% | In Progress → **Completed** |
| All KR initiatives complete | Key Result → **Completed** |

### Data Flow Architecture

**INTERCONNECTED PAGES** (Share data from weekly_checkins table):

```
Dashboard <-- Crew Roster <-- Goals Update <-- Weekly Check-in
```

All these pages read/write from the same data source (weekly_checkins table).

**SEPARATE SYSTEM** (Planning data only affects Export):

```
Planning (FTE) ---------> Export
              Estimations source
```

Planning page estimates are independent and only flow to the Export page.
